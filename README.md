# Digital Skill Up Africa (DSA)-Documentation
This is where I started my Portfolio building during my Data Analysis journey with The Incubator Hub

I have learned several things, including MS Excel, SQL, and portfolio building. Next, we'll deal with Power BI, where we'll study PowerQuery, DAX calculations, Modeling, and Visualization. It is going to be a great time. We had numerous case study projects to gain more insight and clarity. With this knowledge, I will be able to start as an Intern and finish by being a Proficient Data Analyst.

## Project Topic: E-commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E-commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions, which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data source
The data source used here is Data Sale.csv, and this is an open-source dataset that can be freely downloaded online on Kaggle or FRED.

### Tools Used

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions:
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables and errors
3. Cleaning and formatting
