This is where I started my Portfolio building during my Data Analysis journey with The Incubator Hub

I learned a number of things such as : Ms Excel, SQL, now my Portfolio Building and after that we shall deal with Power Bi where we'll study PowerQuery, Dax calculation, Modeling and Visualization. It is going to be a great time.
