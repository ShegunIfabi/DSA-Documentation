This is where I started my Portfolio building during my Data Analysis journey with The Incubator Hub

I learned several things, including MS Excel, SQL, and portfolio building. Next, we'll deal with Power BI, where we'll study PowerQuery, DAX calculations, Modeling, and Visualization. It is going to be a great time. We had numerous case study projects to gain more insight and clarity. With this knowledge, I will be able to start as an Intern and finish by being a Proficient Data Analyst.
